    <p>Oh boy, I could go on for days about Lasagna. I could I suppose, but I would rather not.</p>
    <p>But in all seriousness guys, Lasagna has changed my life. I'll just give you the abbreviated story here: I was down on my luck, wrestling with dogs for blood-stained banana peels. I didn't know how to get out, it was as if there was nowhere to turn. Just when I had all but given up, in walked Lasagna. It's luscious layers of hot thicc meaty sauce making love to that sticky ricotta cheese, all in between those thin sexy layers of pasta. Needless to say, I was in love.</p>
    <p>I knew from that moment on I needed to turn my life around, for Lasagna. Things were getting serious. I would eat her every night, and sweet goodness was it magical. Before I would eat her, I would really get her cooking. Every night, the same thing; every night sweeter than the last. Here's how I did it.</p>
    <p>If you want to please your Lasagna and yourself like I do, you are going to need:</p>
