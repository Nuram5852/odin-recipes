    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <h2><img src="images/lasagna.jpg" alt="A Nice Savory Picture of Lasagna"></h2>
    <p>Oh boy, I could go on for days about Lasagna. I could I suppose, but I would rather not.</p>
    <p>But in all seriousness guys, Lasagna has changed my life. I'll just give you the abbreviated story here: I was down on my luck, wrestling with dogs for blood-stained banana peels. I didn't know how to get out, it was as if there was nowhere to turn. Just when I had all but given up, in walked Lasagna. It's luscious layers of hot thicc meaty sauce making love to that sticky ricotta cheese, all in between those thin sexy layers of pasta. Needless to say, I was in love.</p>
    <p>I knew from that moment on I needed to turn my life around, for Lasagna. Things were getting serious. I would eat her every night, and sweet goodness was it magical. Before I would eat her, I would really get her cooking. Every night, the same thing; every night sweeter than the last. Here's how I did it.</p>
    <p>If you want to please your Lasagna and yourself like I do, you are going to need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces lasagna noodles, cooked to package instructions</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon good quality olive oil</li>
        <li>10 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>10 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 28oz can of marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon powdered garlic</li>
        <li>Enough red pepper flakes to make Thanos shit out the mind stone</li>
        <li>zest of a large lemon</li>
        <li>15 ounces full fat ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cut in 1 inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alright! You now have everything hunted and gathered, time to get that lasagna oiled up and ready.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and place rack in center position. Lasagna and I like things hot and steamy</li>
        <li>Place a large pot of salted water to boil, when boiling add lasagna noodles and cook to package instructions. <strong>While waiting for water to boil:</strong></li>
        <li>Place a <strong>large</strong> pan on cooktop on high heat. Add olive oil, when oil is hot add chopped onion and cook, stirring frequently for five minutes turning down heat when necessary</li>
        <li>Add pork and beef to pan, cook until cooked through (8-10 minutes) using a spatula ot break apart. Season with sea salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Add pasta sauce, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes, turn down to a low simmer</li>
        <li>When meat simmers, zest lemon and add zest to the ricotta cheese, stir well</li>
        <li>When pasta noodle are al dente, strain in colander, rinse under cold water (I give her 4 layers, each with new treasure hidden within for my mouth to discover, so you will need 12. Always cook more than you need though, because when things get rough, and they definitely do, the noodle break)</li>
        <li>Place three lasagna noodles in a ceramic baking dish, spread a layer of meat sauce (approx 1 1/4 cup)onto her naked noodles, then add 1/3 of the white ricotta cheese in a spoonful and 1/3 of mozzarella onto the meat sauce (It doesn't have to be perfect, just estimate). Add another layer of noodles then pasta sauce then cheese then repeat once more. Add the fourth layer of noodles, top with remaing meat sauce and then sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan.</li>
        <li>Place in oven and bake for 35-40 minutes. remove from oven and allow to rest for five minutes (She is going to be worn out if you did it right). Garnish with basil if desired and serve.</li>
    </ol>
